Real-Time Violence Detection

A deep learning-based system for detecting violent behavior in real-time video feeds, designed for smart surveillance and public safety. This project uses OpenCV for video processing, TensorFlow for neural network modeling, and Flask for a web-based interface to stream and display violence detection results.
